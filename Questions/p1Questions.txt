1. Estimate the time it will take you to do the assignment, to within a quarter-hour:
	I estimate the assignment will take about 1.5 hours

2. Estimate the time it took you to complete the assignment:
	Thought/ Design: 1.5 hour
	Programming: 1 hour
	Debuggging: 2.5 hours
	Total: 5 hours

3. To within what precent accuracy was your original estimate:
	This lab took a lot longer than expected. It took a while to understand what the program did on top of actually knowing how to complete the lab.
	I was 30% accurate of my original estimate.
